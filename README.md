# Arc Math Lib


## Overview
Arc Math Lib is a **C++-based mathematical library**, meticulously built **from the ground up** to deliver **high-performance computations** and **structured numerical processing**. Inspired by **GLM's intuitive syntax**, it offers a seamless interface, making **vector operations, matrix manipulations, and complex number computations** feel natural while ensuring **precision and efficiency**.

Designed **without reliance on external libraries**, every component—from **core mathematical constructs** to **custom acceleration models**—has been carefully engineered to provide **full control over implementation and optimization**.

## Features
- **Developed entirely from scratch** – No dependencies, ensuring **maximum flexibility and control**.
- **Vector Mathematics** – Essential **vector operations**, optimized for **high-performance applications**.
- **Matrix Definition** – Provides **structured matrix operations**, supporting transformations and advanced numerical calculations.
- **Complex Number Handling** – Implements **custom-defined complex number operations** for precise mathematical modeling.
- **Defined-from-scratch Mathematical Functions** – Includes functions like `sqroot()` and other **fundamental operations**, crafted with performance in mind.
- **Template Type Generalization** – Offers **versatile mathematical structures**, allowing flexible operations across different types.
- **Custom Acceleration Models** – Implements **additive and multiplicative acceleration techniques** for **physics simulations and numerical analysis**.
- **Optimized Computation** – Engineered for **efficiency, precision, and flexibility** in **scientific and technical applications**.

## Purpose
Arc Math Lib embraces **first-principles engineering**, blending **modern syntax design** with **raw computational power**. With an emphasis on **performance optimization**, it serves as a powerful tool for **scientific modeling, simulation, algorithm development, and structured mathematical computations**.

## Future Roadmap
